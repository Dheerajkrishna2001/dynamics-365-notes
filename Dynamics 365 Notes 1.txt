Dynamics 365 Notes 1

Model - group of elements.

Package - one or more models.

deployment package - one or more package

Number Sequence:

When developing a custom functionality, the first thing we should do is create a number sequence.

NumberSeqApplicationModule derivative classes - holds number sequence setup data for specific module.

Number sequence wizard reads these classes.

Create a class which extends the NumberSeqModuleCustomer

and write loadModule_extension() 


write a runnable class and run this manually.


Organisation administration --> number sequences

<Module>(Account receivable) --> Account receivable parameters --> number sequences.


Renaming a Primary key:

when a primary key is renamed, all the related records should be renamed which can be done using renamePrimaryKey() method.


Document Handling:

allows you to add notes, links, images, files to records in the system.


Use normal tables as temporary tables


Copying Data:

we can use data() method to copy one record to another (make sure pkey is changed.)

buf2buf() - method in Global class

buf2buf vs data - buf2buf is used across companies, it excludes system fields while copying.


Query Objects:

created by drag and drop in AOT,
used for reports, views , forms

can be created through code too.

Macros in a SQL Statement:

full or partial SQL Queries can be called with various arguments.

Allows you to reuse pieces of x++ SQL queries.

it is defined as partial or full SQL Statements with arguments, so that this macro can be used in other SQL queries passing arguments.

This improves reusability of statements.

Executing a SQL Query Directly -:


Date Range:

Set ValidTimeStateFieldType to Date.

two new fields will be added - validTo and validFrom.

create an index named EmpIdRegNoIdx

Set Properties :

AlternateKey		Yes
ValidTimeStateKey	Yes
ValidTimeStateMode	Yes
